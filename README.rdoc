= Setler

Setler is a Gem that lets one easily implement the "Feature Flags" pattern, or add settings to individual models. This is a cleanroom implementation of what the 'rails-settings' gem does. It's been forked all over the place, and my favorite version of it doesn't have any tests and doesn't work with settings associated with models.

== Setup

Install the gem by adding this to your Gemfile:

  gem "setler"

Generate the model:

  rails g setler <model_name>

Run the migration:

  rake db:migrate

If you are using the `protected_attributes` gem you must add `attr_protected` to the top of you setler model.

== Usage

Create/Update settings:

  # Method calls and []= are synonymous
  Featureflags.bacon_dispenser_enabled = true
  Settings[:allowed_meats] = ['bacon', 'crunchy bacon']

Read settings:

  Featureflags.bacon_dispenser_enabled # true
  Settings[:allowed_meats].include?('bacon')  # true

Destroy them:

  Featureflags.destroy :bacon_dispenser_enabled
  Settings.destroy :allowed_meats

List all settings:

  Featureflags.all_settings
  Settings.all_settings

Set defaults in an initializer with something like:

  Featureflags.defaults[:bacon_dispenser_enabled] = false
  Settings.defaults[:allowed_meats] = ['itsnotbacon']

To revert to the default after changing a setting, destroy it.
Note: Updating the setting to nil or false no longer makes it the default setting (> 0.0.6), but changes the setting to nil or false.

Add them to any ActiveRecord object:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_setler  :settings
  end

Then you get:

  user = User.first
  user.settings.favorite_meat = :bacon
  user.settings.favorite_meat  # :bacon
  user.settings.all # { "favorite_meat" => :bacon }

TODO: And look em up:

  User.with_settings_for('favorite_meat') # => scope of users with the favorite_meat setting

== Gem Development

Getting started is pretty straightforward:

  1. Check out the code:  `git clone git://github.com/ckdake/setler.git`
  2. Bundle install:  `bundle install`
  3. Run the tests and make sure they all pass and code coverage is still the same:  `rake test`

If you'd like to contribute code, make your changes and submit a pull request that includes appropriate tests

For building the gem: `rake build` and to release a gem to github and Rubygems: `rake release`
