A small gem containing rules for linting code at Panorama Education.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'panolint'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install panolint

## Usage

### `brakeman`

You can use `panolint`'s `brakeman` configuration in your project by pointing the `brakeman` run at the configuration file in this repo:

```
$ bundle exec brakeman -c "$(bundle show brakeman)/brakeman.yml"
```

### `rubocop`

You can use `panolint`'s rubocop configuration in your project with the following addition to the top of your project's `.rubocop.yml`:

```
inherit_gem:
  panolint: panolint-rubocop.yml
```

Note that it for this gem in particular in needs to not be a `.rubocop.yml` file because of rubocop's [path relativity](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/manual/configuration.md#path-relativity).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
